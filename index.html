                <p class="sectionSubTag texxt-small">If your environmentally friendly restaurant already serves organic
                    food, going organic at the bar is the next step. Start by adding a few organic wines to your drink
                    list.

                    Most wine is made using chemicals and farming practices that are harmful to the environment. Some
                    wineries even inject pesticides and other chemicals directly into the soil, contaminating the
                    surrounding area – and even the vino itself.

                    Begin with this list of 85 organic wines. Also, talk to wineries in your region: many smaller
                    vintners
                    use sustainable practices.</p>

                <p class="sectionSubTag texxt-small">Providing entertainment at your restaurant is a great way to
                    interest
                    new customers and encourage returning guests to come dine with you regularly. Today’s foodies are
                    looking for a complete dining experience, and that includes a great atmosphere as well as an
                    impeccable
                    menu. Hosting entertainment is a great way to encourage customers to come out and dine during the
                    slower
                    days of the week, and can help your restaurant build a lasting reputation in your community. If
                    you’re
                    thinking about adding a little extra something to your restaurant, here are some restaurant
                    entertainment ideas to get you started.
                    There are so many creative and unique restaurant entertainment ideas to incorporate in your
                    restaurant.
                    The type of entertainment you choose should fit the existing brand and atmosphere of your venue, but
                    you
                    should find something for everyone on this list. Upscale diners will look forward to specialty
                    cocktails
                    and a chance to meet the chef, while bars will find themselves overflowing with customers during a
                    craft
                    beer tasting. Whatever kind of restaurant entertainment ideas you choose, adding something extra to
                    your
                    guest experience will ensure those customers come back again and again.</p>
